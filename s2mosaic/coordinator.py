    """
    Create a Sentinel-2 mosaic.

    Three modes — pass exactly one of:
        * ``grid_id`` (e.g. "50HMH"): mosaic an entire MGRS tile.
        * ``bounds`` (minx, miny, maxx, maxy): mosaic an arbitrary bounding
          box. Scenes from any intersecting MGRS tiles are streamed through
          per-scene rasterio WarpedVRT reads and aggregated on a common UTM
          grid in ``output_crs``.
        * ``aoi``: mosaic a single polygon AOI. The output raster uses the
          polygon bounds, with pixels outside the polygon written as nodata.

    ``input_crs`` and ``output_crs`` only apply when ``bounds`` or ``aoi`` is set.

    Args:
        grid_id (str, optional): MGRS tile ID (e.g. "50HMH"). Mutually exclusive with bounds.
        bounds (Tuple[float, float, float, float], optional): Arbitrary AOI
            rectangle as ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` in ``input_crs``.
            Mutually exclusive with ``grid_id``.
        aoi (Polygon or MultiPolygon, optional): AOI in ``input_crs``.
            Mutually exclusive with ``grid_id`` and ``bounds``.
        input_crs (int, optional): EPSG code of ``bounds`` or ``aoi``.
            Defaults to 4326. Only used in bounds/AOI mode.
        start_year (int): The start year of the time range.
        start_month (int, optional): The start month of the time range. Defaults to 1 (January).
        start_day (int, optional): The start day of the time range. Defaults to 1.
        duration_years (int, optional): Duration in years to add to the start date. Defaults to 0.
        duration_months (int, optional): Duration in months to add to the start date. Defaults to 0.
        duration_days (int, optional): Duration in days to add to the start date. Defaults to 0.
        bands (List[str], optional): List of spectral bands.
            Defaults to ["B04", "B03", "B02", "B08"] (Red, Green, Blue, NIR).
        mosaic_method (str, optional): Method to create the mosaic. Options
            are ``"mean"``, ``"first"``, ``"median"``, ``"percentile"`` (with
            ``percentile``), or ``"medoid"``. Defaults to ``"mean"``. The
            ``"medoid"`` mode picks, for each pixel, the scene whose
            multi-band spectrum is closest (squared Euclidean) to the
            per-band median across all valid scenes for that pixel. The
            output is therefore always an actually-observed spectrum
            (band relationships preserved for indices/classifiers) rather
            than the synthetic per-band combination produced by
            ``"median"``/``"percentile"``. This is the approximate-medoid
            formulation common in Google Earth Engine tutorials, not the
            strict Flood 2013 pairwise-distance medoid; the two often agree,
            but can differ.
        percentile (Optional[float], optional): Percentile to calculate
            when using ``mosaic_method="percentile"``. Must be between 0 and 100.
        min_observations (int, optional): Per-tile early-stop target
            for ``mean``, ``percentile``, and ``medoid``. When set,
            aggregation stops reading later scenes for a tile once every
            coverable pixel has at least this many valid observations. This is
            not an output quality filter. Defaults to None.
        max_observations (int, optional): Per-pixel cap for ``mean``,
            ``percentile``, and ``medoid``. Each pixel accepts at most this
            many valid scenes, in ``scene_order``; later valid scenes are
            dropped for that pixel. Combined with ``scene_order="oldest"`` /
            ``"newest"`` this biases the mosaic to early or late dates. Must
            be >= ``min_observations`` when both are set. Ignored by ``first``
            (effectively N=1).
            Defaults to None.
        include_observation_count (bool, optional): Append an ``Observation count``
            band containing the number of valid source scenes contributing to
            each output pixel. For visual exports, enabling this writes the
            GeoTIFF/returned array as ``uint16`` so the count band is not
            limited to 255. Defaults to False.
        source (str, optional): STAC imagery source. ``"MPC"`` (default) uses
            Microsoft Planetary Computer (SAS-signed URLs); ``"AWS"`` uses
            Element 84 Earth Search on AWS Open Data (public S3, no auth).
            Defaults to "MPC".
        additional_query (Dict[str, Any], optional): Additional query parameters for STAC API.
            Defaults to {"eo:cloud_cover": {"lt": 100}}.
        min_coverage_fraction (float, optional): Drop pixels covered by fewer
            than this fraction of overlapping scenes. Set to None to disable.
            Defaults to None.
        first_coverage_target (float, optional): Early-stop target for
            ``mosaic_method="first"``, as a fraction in (0, 1] of in-coverage
            pixels. Phase 1 stops fetching cloud masks once the running
            composite reaches it, leaving the shortfall as nodata. Defaults to
            None, which requires every in-coverage pixel to be filled — a bar
            cloudy scenes rarely clear, so the stop seldom fires.
        ignore_duplicate_items (bool, optional): Whether to remove duplicate scenes based on their IDs. Defaults to True.
        scene_order (str, optional): Scene ordering. Options are "valid_data", "oldest", or "newest". Defaults to "valid_data".
        scene_sort_fn (Callable, optional): Custom sorting function. If provided, overrides scene_order.
        cloud_mask (str, optional): Cloud-mask provider. ``"OCM"`` (default) runs the
            OmniCloudMask deep-learning model on R+G+NIR; ``"SCL"`` reads the L2A
            Scene Classification Layer published with the scene. SCL is much cheaper
            (one COG read, no inference) but lower accuracy.
        ocm_batch_size (int, optional): Batch size for OCM inference. Defaults to 1.
        ocm_inference_dtype (str, optional): Data type for OCM inference.
            Defaults to "fp32" for the broadest device compatibility — runs on
            every CPU/GPU/MPS backend and is also the fastest option on CPU
            (most CPUs lack efficient fp16/bf16 paths). On GPU, switch to
            "fp16" for ~2× speedup with lower VRAM use, or "bf16" on hardware
            that supports it (Ampere+ NVIDIA, Apple Silicon).
        ocm_tuning (OcmTuning, optional): OCM mask sensitivity controls —
            clear-probability threshold, cloud dilation, and clear-mask
            cleanup sizes. Defaults to None, which keeps the historical
            argmax behaviour. See :class:`s2mosaic.OcmTuning`.
        output_crs (int, optional): EPSG code for the output grid. Must be a
            projected CRS — geographic CRSes (e.g. 4326) are rejected at
            validation, because ``resolution`` is interpreted as metres in the
            target CRS and a geographic output would produce a degenerate
            grid. If you need a lat/lon raster, reproject the mosaic
            afterwards (e.g. with ``gdalwarp``). In bounds/AOI mode, defaults
            to the UTM zone containing the AOI centroid. Ignored in grid mode.
        resolution (int, optional): Output pixel size in metres. Defaults to 10.
        resampling_method (str, optional): Rasterio resampling method used when
            reading source COGs onto the output grid. Options include "nearest",
            "bilinear", "cubic", "average", and "lanczos". Defaults to "nearest".
        snap_to_source_grid (bool, optional): Bounds/AOI mode only. When True,
            expand the output extent outward to whole multiples of
            ``resolution`` in the target CRS, so repeat runs over the same area
            produce identical grids and (at ``resolution=10``) align with the
            native Sentinel-2 pixel grid — making reads zero-cost copies
            instead of sub-pixel resamples. The output may grow by up to one
            pixel on each side. Defaults to False (use the exact requested
            bounds; sub-pixel offsets are absorbed by ``resampling_method``).
            For repeatable cross-run alignment, also pass ``output_crs``
            explicitly — otherwise the auto-picked UTM zone can shift between
            runs (e.g. if bounds are tweaked slightly across the centroid's
            UTM-zone boundary), and snapping in a different CRS does not
            preserve the grid.
        output_dir (Optional[Union[Path, str]], optional): Directory to save
            the output GeoTIFF using an auto-generated filename. Mutually
            exclusive with ``output_path``. If neither is provided, the mosaic
            is returned instead. Defaults to None.
        output_path (Optional[Union[Path, str]], optional): Full GeoTIFF path
            to write, including the filename. Mutually exclusive with
            ``output_dir``. Defaults to None.
        overwrite (bool, optional): Whether to overwrite existing output files. Defaults to True.
        tile_workers (int, optional): Number of output tiles to aggregate
            concurrently. Higher values can improve throughput for
            network-bound reads, but increase memory use and simultaneous
            source reads. Defaults to ``min(4, os.cpu_count() or 1)``.
        adaptive_tiling (bool, optional): Split sparse output tiles based on
            the actual cloud-valid contribution masks. Reduces wasted reads for
            irregular AOIs and sparse scene coverage. Defaults to True.
        show_progress (bool, optional): Show tqdm progress bars for the
            cloud-mask and tile-aggregation phases. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Union[Tuple[npt.NDArray[Any], Dict[str, Any]], Path]: If no export path
        is requested, returns the mosaic array and metadata dictionary.
        Otherwise returns the path to the saved GeoTIFF file.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs fail validation, or if no scenes are found for the
            specified grid_id / bounds and time range.
        RuntimeError: If scenes were found but all were fully cloud-masked or
            invalid, or if every scene failed to fetch after retries.

    Note:
        - The function uses the STAC API to search for Sentinel-2 scenes.
        - If 'visual' is included in bands, it will be replaced with 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue' in the output.
        - The time range for scene selection is inclusive of the start date and exclusive of the end date.
